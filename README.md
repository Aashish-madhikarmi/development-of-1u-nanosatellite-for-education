Development of 1U Nanosatellite for Education
An open-source CubeSat project for learning and experimentation is project aims to design and develop a 1U nanosatellite (CubeSat) as an **educational platform** for students and researchers to understand the fundamentals of satellite systems — including hardware design, communication, control, and software integration.

The system is modular and open-source, allowing replication, modification, and experimentation at a low cost.

🛰️ Project Overview
The **1U CubeSat** is a miniature satellite designed for academic purposes. It integrates:
- On-Board Computer (OBC): Raspberry Pi Zero W  
- Power System: Custom 3.7V LiPo with boost and regulation circuits  
- Sensors:** MPU6050 (IMU), temperature sensors, current sensors  
- Communication: SDR-based radio with SMA connector  
- Actuation: Magnetorquers for attitude control  
- Structure: 3D-printed modular frame
